## TL;DR

* :speech_balloon: Verbihr is a self-learning tool purpose whose aim is to help learning German irregular verbs.
* 📖 Over 100 verbs to learn available.
* 🌍 Translated in several languages (yes even in german).
* 🕵️ No data collected, no cookies needed.

## How to access the application

Simple, it is deployed directly on GitHub right there : https://nag763.github.io/verbihr/

## Motivation

I was frustrated to not find a tool that matched my learning way (fail and retry) and since I am learning German, it quickly became a barrier.

## Disclaimer

This app was developed in a limited scope of time and thus some of the inputs have been translated with the help of ChatGPT.

If you realize that some of the verbs are incorrectly conjugated, your help is more than welcome. The source file for verbs can be found right there : https://github.com/nag763/verbihr/blob/main/src/resources/irregular_verbs.yaml

Same goes for translations, I obviously don't speak all the languages the app is using and thus if you are a native speaker of any of these who realizes these can be improved, feel free to correct the followings : https://github.com/nag763/verbihr/blob/main/src/resources/translation.yaml

## Want to help ?

Actually this tool (unless requested) will only be modified if I feel like something is needed during my learning experience.

If you do think other features should be added, fill in this form : 

But of course if you want to contribute by your own to the source code, feel free to as well 😄

Leaving a star if this project helped you in completing any of your project's feature would also be a small but appreciated help ⭐
